# Scribe [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luetkemj/scribe.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luetkemj/scribe)

Scribe is a tool used for my own weekly DnD game. The main functionality consitists of a timekeeper and campaign log.

## Run the Application ##

To run the application, some initial setup is required:

### Install Node ###

Since this is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) project, please make sure
Node is installed on the machine. A recommended install method is to use
[nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) which installs Node into your
home directory.

### Install Dependencies ###

Once Node is installed, from this project's root directory run the following
command to install the project dependencies:

`$ npm install`

### Data ###

Certain features of this project depends on existing data. If you run the app without existing data you will find that the monster and items codex will be empty. It's ok - you're not missing much.

### Start the App ###

This project is configured to load separate configuration based on the
environment where it is run (for example, `development` vs `production`).
The environment is specified via the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.
If no environment is specified, it will default to `development`.

To start the application (in development mode), execute the following command:

`$ npm start`

This script will call `babel-node` to run the server side code in an "esnext"
environment. This compiles all the server side source code into ES5 to run
via `node` (it caches the compiled code to memory). This also runs `webpack`
in a "development" manner that similarly loads all the packs to memory and serves
them up when requested. This is to allow dynamic updates while developing.

(It is [not advised](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/#babel-node)
to run `babel-node` in `production` environment, so an alternate path is taken
for `npm run production`. Please see below for more details.)

The current available environments include:

*   `development`
*   `production`

#### Production ####

In production mode the application is setup to use minified assets.
The `build` task produces both compiled server side assets and minified
webpack client side assets. To execute this task, run the following command:

`$ npm run build`

The `production-build` task performs the same actions as the `build` task,
but removes any development dependencies and only retains those files necessary
to run the server in a production environment. This was done to limit the size
of the deliverable.

`$ npm run production-build`

(Note that both the `build` or `production-build` tasks produce the same build
assets -- it is only required to run one command.)

Once the build assets are generated, to start the server in the `production`
environment, execute the following command:

`$ npm run production`

This command does not watch for file changes and only serves up what was produced
during the `production-build` script execution. This was done to allow a separate
"production" process to monitor the state of the server, and not restart
automatically if changes are made to the file system.

### Configuration ###

Most all of the app's configuration is held within the `server/config/index.js`
file. Some of these values can be specified via environment variables. Below is
a list of those variables:

* Node Server
    * `PORT` : The port for the node application server, defaults to `3000` in all environments.
    * `MONGO_PROTOCOL` : Mongo database protocol, defaults to `mongodb://` in all environments.
    * `MONGO_HOST` : Mongo database host, defaults to `localhost` in all environments.
    * `MONGO_PORT` : Mongo database port, defaults to `27017` in all environments
    * `MONGO_DB` : Mongo database name, defaults to `scribe` in all environments

## Tests ##

There are tests for the client and server side code, which use
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) as the test framework. Running the `test`
script will lint the files and run the tests. This can be done by
executing the following command:

`$ npm test`

To only run the mocha tests, execute:

`$ npm run test:mocha`

To run the mocha tests in a "watch" mode:

`$ npm run test:watch`

## Test App ##

A test application is available to test out components used within the main
application. To run the test app, execute the following command:

`$ npm run test-app`

The contents of the test application are not included in the webpack bundle
used in the main application. The `TEST_APP` environment variable is used
to determine which application `index.js` file to use, which imports in the
necessary files.

## Contributing ##

If you would like to contibute to this project some good first tickets can be [found here](https://github.com/luetkemj/scribe/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

To contribute, fork this repository, write code, submit a pull request.

This project uses mocha and should for tests, airbnb's eslint config, and a custom sass-lint config. Before submitting a pull request you should run `npm test` to ensure your branch can me merged. New features should include tests where appropriate.
